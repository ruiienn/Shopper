        <h1>About Savings</h1>
        <p>
            Saving is income not spent, or deferred consumption. Methods of saving include putting money aside in, for
            example, a deposit account, a pension account, an investment fund, or as cash. Saving also involves reducing
            expenditures, such as recurring costs. In terms of personal finance, saving generally specifies low-risk
            preservation of money, as in a deposit account, versus investment, wherein risk is a lot higher; in
            economics more broadly, it refers to any income not used for immediate consumption. Saving does not
            automatically include interest.
